I got so tired of filling and clicking on this damn site: https://hackertarget.com. So I wanted to pass a host/IP and have it spawn puppeteer and request all the scans.

Zapier then setup so file attachments get saved to a folder in Google Drive, which is slick and nice for organization purposes.

## Getting Started

Clone
add your config


`tsc && npm run link`

Congrats, now you can quickly scan targets while doing other stuff in the CLI.
